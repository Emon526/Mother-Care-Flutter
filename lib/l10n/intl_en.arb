"awarenessBody2":"Why? Because the earlier signs of breast cancer are detected and treated, the better the chances of recovery.\n\nRegular check-ups with your gynaecologist or trusted health professional can help to detect breast cancer at an early stage. Your doctor may also recommend a mammogram.\n\nBut you can do more to protect yourself by checking your own breasts regularly!\n\nRegular self-checks are the best way to get to know what is normal for you, and will help you notice changes more quickly. The faster you notice, the sooner you'll be able to react and get treatment if needed.\n\nAnd if there's one thing we know about breast cancer, it's that the earlier it's treated, the greater the likelihood of survival.",
