# Security Policy for Mother Care

At Mother Care, we take the security of our project seriously. We are committed to ensuring the safety and privacy of our users and their data. This security policy outlines our approach to security and the supported security versions for the project.

## Supported Security Versions

We actively support and maintain security for the following versions of Mother Care:

1. Flutter framework: [Specify the supported versions of Flutter, e.g., 2.2.3, 2.3.0, etc.]

2. Dependencies and Libraries: We regularly update and patch dependencies and libraries used in Mother Care to the latest stable versions that include security fixes. It is important to keep these dependencies up to date to ensure a secure environment.

## Security Best Practices

We encourage all contributors to follow these security best practices when working on Mother Care:

1. **Secure Authentication**: Implement secure authentication mechanisms, such as password hashing, encryption, and the use of secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) to protect user credentials and sensitive data.

2. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.

3. **Data Protection**: Ensure that sensitive user data, including personally identifiable information (PII), is handled securely. Follow encryption practices and protect data both in transit and at rest.

4. **Authorization and Access Control**: Implement proper authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive functionality and data based on user roles and permissions.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms to prevent the exposure of sensitive information and provide useful feedback without disclosing system details.

6. **Secure Communication**: Use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) when transmitting data between the client application and backend servers.

7. **Regular Updates**: Stay up to date with the latest security patches and updates for the Flutter framework and other dependencies used in Mother Care.
